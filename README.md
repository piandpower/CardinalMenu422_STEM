--------------------------------------------
Modifying Starting Map or Number of Players
--------------------------------------------
1. Navigate to the MainMenu Blueprints folder at \Cardinal\MainMenu\Blueprints
2. Insert your GameModes into Enum_GameModes, list your available map names to Enum_Maps, and set your server host's preferred maximum number of players to Enum_NumberOfPlayers using the supplied pattern. 
For skipped number of player options, use the enumeration's integer. For the number of players option you'd like available, spell out the integer. 
For example: 0, 1, Three will make a server with a maximum of "Three Players." (Please note the game modes and player limits are not implemented in the actual project. This is up to the end user to implement.)

--------------------------------------------
Deploying Packaged Builds
--------------------------------------------
In order for key bindings to work on packaged builds, you you may have to copy Input.ini from inside your project to the build directory.
The paths and default bindings are listed below. Input.ini may not copy into the directory by itself. The default bindings are shown below for your convenience.

--------------------------------------------
Windows US Keyboard Default Input Bindings
Inside Project:
\Config\DefaultInput.ini
\Build\WindowsNoEditor\CardinalMenu\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor\DefaultInput.ini
Inside Packaged Game:
\WindowsNoEditor\CardinalMenu\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor\Input.ini
